# maths_images
A library for plotting a variety of mathematical images

The functions in *chaotic_maps.py* and *fractals.py* have been written such that when called with no arguments,
they will produce a nice output image. For most of them however, the user can override the default values of the
parameters to customise the output.

For example usage, see *main.py*.

For example plots, see *images*.
